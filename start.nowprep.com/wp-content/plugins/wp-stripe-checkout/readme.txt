Sell anything from your WordPress site with Stripe. Accept credit card payments via streamlined checkout and mobile-ready payment form.

== Description ==

[WordPress Stripe Checkout](https://noorsplugin.com/stripe-checkout-plugin-for-wordpress/) plugin allows you to accept payments with the Stripe payment gateway. You can integrate Stripe's payment form into your website with a simple shortcode. This makes accepting credit card payments easier than ever with very little setup and effort.

= What is Stripe Checkout Form? =

Stripe Checkout Form is a beautiful payment form specifically designed for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. Your customer never go to an external payment page for making the payments. They stay on your site and enter their credit card in a secure payment form to complete the payment.

= Does Stripe Checkout require HTTPS? =

All payment submissions are made via a secure HTTPS connection. However, in order to fully protect sensitive customer data, you must serve the page containing the Stripe payment form over HTTPS. In short, the address of the page containing the Stripe checkout form must start with "https://" rather than just "http://".
